Child’s Play is an abstract NFT collection made by *my daughter* when she was around 18 months old. There are 101 pieces that she’s created both on iPad and on paper. Let’s just say that **this is a very special collection.**

Creating is a joy. It’s play. It’s expressive. Kids do it naturally. Let this abstract collection of art done by an 18 month old child inspire you to create.
