<h2>Level up. Learn. Create. Have Fun</h2>

<p>I believe we're born to create. But I know it’s hard, difficult, tricky, and damn-near impossible at times. Learning new things can be overwhelming, time-consuming and confusing. I’m here to help. I want you to make awesome stuff. I want to demystify the magic of creating. Because I love creating <em>and</em> learing—and then teaching you what I know in short, fun and easy-to-start ways.</p>

<p>I teach thousands of people the stuff I know in ways I wish people had taught me. Think fun, easy to watch, practical classes that empower you to rock your creative universe. There are classes on design, creativity, productivity, coding, animation, and illustration.</p>

<p>I host my classes <a href="https://ttkb.me/sk">on Skillshare</a> because you pay a yearly subscription and can take as many classes as you like—of mine, and thousands of other teachers.
