In 2022 I began calling myself an artist. This changed everything. I began creating like the 6 year old me sitting at his little white art table. For the joy of it. I rediscovered my inner kid. I began spending more time on my “doodles”. I began selling them as NFTs. Then I began doing murals. And clothing. And appearing on Adobe Live. I’m now a few years into being an artist and doing the things I resisted for a lot of my life—doodling, drawing, exploring things I’m curious about. I love it. I get to be authentic. I get to express myself. And I get to spread hope and joy in the world.

Before this I’d called myself many things—entrepreneur, workshop facilitator, author, teacher, product designer, animator—I was basically a unicorn. I still call myself these things from time to time, but being an artist is my true identity. It allows me the freedom to explore the vast realms of art, doodling, business, and technology—with analog and digital tools. And it pairs really well with having ADHD.
