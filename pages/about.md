# About Rich The Artist
## Reconnecting viewers with their inner child

I’m a multi-hyphenate artist based in Amsterdam. I bring imagination to life through vibrant and playful creations. My work features bold colours, dreamlike scenarios, and quirky characters. I invite viewers to reconnect with their inner child, to smile, and to hope. Stories and themes of dreams, transitions, and exploration inspire my creations.

My art has evolved from ADHD doodles in my school books to artwork for brands like Adobe, Ava Labs, and On That Ass. I create bold and vibrant illustrations,  murals, and merchandise artwork. Each piece sparks joy, playfulness and possibility.

When I’m not creating my own artwork, I’m helping others with theirs. I’ve helped over 250,000 people improve their artistic skills with books, courses, and as a mentor. I also enjoy speciality coffee, dancing badly, and doodling with my daughter.

My mission is simple: to create art that reconnects viewers with the joys of childhood.
