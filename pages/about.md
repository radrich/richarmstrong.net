I’m an multi-hyphenate artist, writer, and creative un-sticker living in Amsterdam. Now, I haven’t always called myself an artist. Over the years, I’ve written code, animated things, designed stuff, and taught online. All creative. All for money.

Now, I make bold, playful art and help other creatives get out of their own way (it’s more common than you think). I use every version of my past self to do what I do now—better, weirder, and with more heart.

## My art

My work is vibrant, emotional, and full of strange creatures and characters. Sometimes it’s joyful and silly. Other times it’s abstract and raw. It all started with adhd-fuelled doodles in school notebooks. Now they’re all grown up and live on walls, undies, hoodies, and in digital wallets as NFTs. And they’ve made appearances for awesome brands like like Adobe, Frankly Doodle, and On That Ass.

**My mission is simple:** make art that reminds you what it felt like to be a kid. I want you to dream again, believe anything is possible, and delve into your imagination. I want you to feel a little more human.

## Helping creatives unstick themselves

When I’m not making art, I’m helping other creatives finish what they start. And sometimes just start. 250k+ people have read my books and taken my courses. They’ve learned new skills, beat procrastination, made plans, found creative flow, and done difficult things.

## A few extra things:

- I love specialty coffee.
- I dance like no one’s watching.
- Can touch my nose with my tongue.
- Doodle beside my daughter as often as possible.

- This is a great [article](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/artist-spotlight-tap-tap-kabooms-vast-nft-doodleverse-d9e2c52bd3a7) about myself and The Doodleverse on the Avalanche blog.

I haven’t always called myself an artist. I’ve been a motion graphic designer, a UI/UX designer, and an interactive developer. I’ve worked as an employee at an agency, as a freelancer, as a startup employee, and as a business owner. **One thing I’ve loved throughout all these phases is teaching people to create and to succeed.**

When I created a short class in 2015 on how to create a website from scratch I did it because everyone who stood behind me, while I coded, marvelled at my genius ability. I knew that learning to code was easy—if you understood the basics. I loved creating this class. It changed my life. And it changed thousands of other peoples’ lives. Since then I’ve created classes on everything I thought could help creatives—and people who didn’t think they were creative. Over the past few years I’ve **taught over 250,000 students** a bunch of skills, tools, and techniques.

TapTapKaboom’s mission is to fire up people’s creativity and help creatives achieve their next level of success. I know what it’s like to feel stuck. I know what it’s like to not “get” something, and then to “get” it. And I’ve seen others go through the exact same thing. I also know what it’s like to have a dream come true, to make an app and a website for the first time, to get a book published. I know what it’s like to wake up with a sparkle in your eyes and a fire in your soul. Creating does that. That’s what I want to share. That’s what I want to get every single person on the planet doing. Creating. Intentionally. As themseleves. And going after those dreams. It’s possible.

Big loves ❤️  
**Rich from TapTapKaboom**
