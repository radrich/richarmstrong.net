Hi there. Rich here. I’m a multi-hyphenate artist living in Amsterdam. But I haven’t always called myself an artist. In fact, I’ve had many titles. But to simplify things, I’ve written code, animated, designed, and taught online. All very creative. All for money. Now I art, write, and help creatives unstick themselves (more common than you know). I use my past “lives” to do what I do now better, and to better help my students and clients.

### My art
When it comes to my art, it’s playful, vibrant, and full of weird creatures. However, sometimes it’s more abstract and deals with feelings and raw expression. My art has evolved from adhd doodles in my school books to artwork for brands like Adobe, Ava Labs, and On That Ass.

My mission is simple: to create art that reconnects viewers with the joys of childhood.

I’m a multi-hyphenate artist based in Amsterdam. I bring imagination to life through vibrant and playful creations. My work features bold colours, dreamlike scenarios, and quirky characters. I invite viewers to reconnect with their inner child, to smile, and to hope. Stories and themes of dreams, transitions, and exploration inspire my creations.

### Helping creatives unstick themselves
When I’m not creating my own artwork, I’m helping others with theirs. I’ve helped 250k+ people improve their artistic skills with books, courses, and coaching.

I also enjoy speciality coffee, dancing badly, and doodling with my daughter.


### What else do I do?
- I teach creative classes in fun ways at [TapTapKaboom.](https://www.taptapkaboom.com)
- I’ve written a book called [The Perfect 100 Day Project](/the-perfect-100-day-project-book/) published by RockyNook.

<p class="center">Hey! I’m Rich Armstrong. I’m the founder of TapTapKaboom. I’m also a multi-hyphenate artist who’s authored books and taught thousands of students.</p>

I haven’t always called myself an artist. I’ve been a motion graphic designer, a UI/UX designer, and an interactive developer. I’ve worked as an employee at an agency, as a freelancer, as a startup employee, and as a business owner. **One thing I’ve loved throughout all these phases is teaching people to create and to succeed.**

When I created a short class in 2015 on how to create a website from scratch I did it because everyone who stood behind me, while I coded, marvelled at my genius ability. I knew that learning to code was easy—if you understood the basics. I loved creating this class. It changed my life. And it changed thousands of other peoples’ lives. Since then I’ve created classes on everything I thought could help creatives—and people who didn’t think they were creative. Over the past few years I’ve **taught over 250,000 students** a bunch of skills, tools, and techniques.

TapTapKaboom’s mission is to fire up people’s creativity and help creatives achieve their next level of success. I know what it’s like to feel stuck. I know what it’s like to not “get” something, and then to “get” it. And I’ve seen others go through the exact same thing. I also know what it’s like to have a dream come true, to make an app and a website for the first time, to get a book published. I know what it’s like to wake up with a sparkle in your eyes and a fire in your soul. Creating does that. That’s what I want to share. That’s what I want to get every single person on the planet doing. Creating. Intentionally. As themseleves. And going after those dreams. It’s possible.

Big loves ❤️
