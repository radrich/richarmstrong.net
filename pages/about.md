In 2022 I began calling myself an artist. This changed everything. I began creating like the 6 year old me sitting at his little white art table. For the joy of it. I rediscovered my inner kid. I began spending more time on my “doodles”. I began selling them as NFTs. Then I began doing murals. And clothing. And appearing on Adobe Live. And I feel I still have so much more to share, and so much more to learn.

Before this I’d called myself many things—entrepreneur, workshop facilitator, author, teacher, product designer, animator—basically a unicorn. I still call myself these things from time to time, but I feel like I’m an artist at my core. I love creativity. I love creating. I love making. I have a vivid imagination. I have ADHD—which responds really well to drawing. So this is me.
