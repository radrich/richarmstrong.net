<p>TapTapKaboom started when I (Rich Armstrong) created <a href="http://skl.sh/2lzLHlT">a short class</a> on how to create a website from scratch. I did it because everyone who stood behind me, while I coded, marvelled at my ability and thought I was a genius. <em>I am a genius.</em> But I knew that learning to code was easy—if you understood the basics. Since then I've created a bunch of classes and <strong>taught thousands of students</strong> a bunch of skills, tools, and techniques. That lead me to change careers from a product designer to a teacher, author, and artist.</p>

<p>I believe that we're born to create. And I’ve made it my mission to help you make awesome stuff. I love demystifying the magic of creating—in fun and approachable ways.</p>

<h2>About Rich</h2>
<p>This is where I switch to talking about myself in third person. Rich is an artist. But honesty he’s more of a jack-of-all-trades. Or a generalist. Or maybe even a unicorn! He’s got ADHD you see. So he draws, writes, doodles, animates, and codes. He’s got a BA degree in multimedia design, a BTech Honours degree in Graphic Design, and he taught himself how to code. He’s freelanced, worked for agencies and startups, and now runs his own studio. He’s always creating. He has super ginger-powers and can touch his nose with his tongue!</p>
