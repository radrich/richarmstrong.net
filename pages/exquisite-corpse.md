**You want to collaborate on something fun?** You’ve heard of Exquisite Corpse right? It’s where a few people contribute toward a ‘body’. Typically someone draws the head, someone else the body, and someone else the legs.

But with this project **there’s going to be more than 3 of us.** We’re going to be creating a super duper long Exquisite Corpse!

## Why This Project?
Because we’ve been in some form of COVID lockdown for over a year!  
**Let’s connect with each other!**

## Want To Participate?

1. Download the [template file.](https://ttkb.me/corpse-template)
2. Start and end your illustration within the lines on the right and left.
3. Illustrate/design the rest of page however you like.
4. [Upload your final piece here on Dropbox](https://ttkb.me/corpse-submit) by Friday April 23.
5. I’ll be combining it into one large body!

I’m pumped to see how this turns out!
