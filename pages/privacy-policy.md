### FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

"Financial incentive" means a program, benefit, or other offering, including payments to consumers as compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, sale, or sharing of personal information.

The law permits financial incentives or a price or service difference if it is reasonably related to the value of the consumer's data. A business must be able to explain how the financial incentive or price or service difference is reasonably related to the value of the consumer's data.

The explanation must include:

- a good-faith estimate of the value of the consumer's data that forms the basis for offering the financial incentive or price or service difference; and
- a description of the method the business used to calculate the value of the consumer's data.\\n We may decide to offer a financial incentive (e.g., price or service difference) in exchange for the retention, sale, or sharing of a consumer's personal information.

_We do not offer financial incentives to collect personal information and we will not discriminate against you if you exercise any of the rights provided by applicable laws set forth in this Privacy Policy. Please note that a legitimate denial of a request for information, deletion, or to opt-out is not discriminatory, nor is charging a fee for excessive or repetitive consumer requests as permitted by applicable laws._
