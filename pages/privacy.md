## What kind of tracking is used by Ric Armstrong?
On richarmstrong.net we do not track individual behaviour. We use [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/) to track site usage and non-personal identification information. These are things like:

- Browser name
- Device type
- Country
- Pages visited

On [TapTapKaboom School](school.taptapkaboom.com) your individual user behaviour and class progress **is tracked.** This is to provide you with a personalised learning experience. Without tracking your individual user behaviour, TapTapKaboom School would not function properly.

## Do we use ‘cookies’?
Yes we do, but **not on richarmstrong.net.** Your web browser places cookies on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about you. You may choose to set your web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being used. If you do so, some parts of [TapTapKaboom School](school.taptapkaboom.com) may not function properly (see above). You can read [Teachable’s cookie policy](https://teachable.com/cookies-policy) for more information.

## How do you handle Do Not Track (DNT) signals?
This does not apply on richarmstrong.net as individual behaviour is not tracked. But on [TapTapKaboom School](school.taptapkaboom.com) DNT signals are not responded to. Please read Teachable and Gumroad’s privacy policies for more information.
