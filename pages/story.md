<p>TapTapKaboom started when I (Rich Armstrong) created <a href="http://skl.sh/2lzLHlT">a short class</a> on how to create a website from scratch. I did it because everyone who stood behind me, while I coded, marvelled at my ability and thought I was a genius. I am a genius ðŸ™‚ but I knew that learning to code was easy. If you understood the basics. Since then I've created a bunch of classes and <strong>taught thousands of students</strong> a bunch of skills, tools, and techniques.</p>

<p>I believe that we're born to create. And I've made it my mission ðŸš€ to help you make awesome stuff. I love demystifying the magic of creating â€“ in fun and approachable ways.</p>
