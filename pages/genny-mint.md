Genny is a new and different kind of magic to The Doodleverse. Generative art pieces—art made with code—feels different. It’s mathematical. It’s random. It’s a different type of beauty.

Occasionally, you’ll be able to mint new Gennys! Sometimes it’ll be for specific wallet addresses. Other times it’ll be open to anyone. Connect your wallet, switch to the Avalanche blockchain, and hit that mint button.

All the 1/1 of Genny pieces are made using code. And each piece is derived from an algorithm that I wrote. Some Gennys are animated. When this is the case I’ve generated frames, compiled them together and exported a video file. The Gennys that aren’t animations can be printed at *massive* sizes! I’d love to see you print, frame, and share your Gennys with me and the community.
