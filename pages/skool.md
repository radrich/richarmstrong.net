In 2024 I created a Skool group. I wanted to host my own community there. But it was really someone else’s dream that I was trying to live. In hindsight, I didn’t have the time, energy, or strategy for it. So I closed it down. With the mental space and energy it freed up, I could focus on other things that help people create.
