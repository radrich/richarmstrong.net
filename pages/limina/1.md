Not everything about the fallen gateways was bad. The collapse of gateways birthed playfulness and joy. Ecstasy bloomed. Laughter echoed around the broken gateway, and playful ideas erupted.

### LIMINA
After The Dreamheadz found their way into The Realm of Dreams, everyone wanted access. The Order built seven gates leading to the epicentre of the Doodleverse. They called it Project LIMINA. But, upon their completion, the gates buckled and broke. Cosmic waves rippled through the realms. The Doodleverse began to unravel. The Shadow reemerged. Creatures fled their homes. Glitches appeared. It was chaos. But, a single gate remains open.

With LIMINA, I collaborated with other “realms” of myself. I used different styles, skillsets, and methods within single pieces. Some methods include collage, doodling, abstract art, and generative art (code art). The collection touches on the topics of chaos, ADHD, and artistic influence.
