One portal stood resilient. Its existence safeguarded by a nebula of brave creatures. Their joy, a bastion against The Shadow, kept hope alive. They had a chance of defeating The Shadow forever.

### LIMINA
After The Dreamheadz found their way into The Realm of Dreams, everyone wanted access. The Order built seven gates leading to the epicentre of the Doodleverse. They called it Project LIMINA. But, upon their completion, the gates buckled and broke. Cosmic waves rippled through the realms. The Doodleverse began to unravel. The Shadow reemerged. Creatures fled their homes. Glitches appeared. It was chaos. But, a single gate remains open.

With LIMINA, I collaborated with other “realms” of myself. I used different styles, skillsets, and methods within single pieces. Some methods include collage, doodling, abstract art, and generative art (code art). The collection touches on the topics of chaos, ADHD, and artistic influence.
