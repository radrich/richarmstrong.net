Join 2k+ people getting creative nuggets, stories, and resources delivered to their inbox.

I send short daily emails to help stuck creatives get unstuck. If you procrastinate, start too many things, never finish them, or feel overwhelmed by all your ideas… you’ll enjoy seeing these emails in your inbox. I’m an artist, illustrator, and creative coach living in Amsterdam. I write to fellow creatives like we’re pen pals. Expect stories, doodles, insecurities, experiments, and the occasional firecracker idea to help you move forward. It’s made for artists and illustrators, but anyone who makes stuff will feel at home here.
