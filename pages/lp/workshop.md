# Get Unstuck.<br>Solve the Real Problem.<br>Move Forward (Together).

You don’t need another meeting.  
You don’t need a “creative offsite.”  

You need clarity.

Real ideas.

A confident decision.

A team that’s actually on the same page when they leave the room.

**That’s what I help you do.**

## Hi, I’m Rich 👋 I run creativity-fueled problem-solving workshops for humans.

Not the awkward kind where everyone groans through icebreakers.  
Not the kind where the loudest person wins.  
And definitely not the kind where nothing actually changes.

## I help individuals and teams:

- Uncover the real problem
- Generate meaningful solutions
- Make decisions with confidence
- Leave with a clear plan and momentum

**All in a 4-hour to 2-day experience that’s visual, fast-paced, and even fun.**

## Why It Works (Even If Nothing Else Has)

Most teams are stuck because they’ve tried everything *except* looking at the problem creatively.

## What I bring:

- A playful, ADHD-friendly, neurodivergent-informed approach  
- Visual tools that help people think better (yes, doodles!)  
- A facilitation style that includes quiet thinkers *and* bold talkers  
- Custom workshops designed for your problem and your people

I don’t show up with answers.  
I draw the answers out of **you**.

## Workshop Formats

All sessions are custom-built based on your challenge.  
But here’s the menu:

### 🔥 4-Hour Spark Session  
Get unstuck. Make a decision.  
Perfect for one big problem, fast.

### 🧠 1-Day Deep Dive  
Uncover root issues. Explore solutions. Leave with clarity and alignment.

### 🚀 2-Day Momentum Builder  
Tackle complex challenges or cross-team problems with creativity, energy, and a solid plan forward.

🧃 All sessions are **IRL**, hosted in relaxed spaces with great food and zero Zoom fatigue.

## What You Get

- A custom-designed workshop based on **your** problem
- Full facilitation and prep (no awkward guesswork)
- Visual outputs: photos, doodles, notes
- A lightweight guide to help you integrate what you uncovered

No bloated reports. No follow-up sales pitch. Just clarity and confidence.

## Is This For You?

This is *not* a cookie-cutter brainstorm.  
This is for you if:

- You’ve been stuck for weeks (or months)
- Meetings go in circles
- There’s tension, confusion, or stalled momentum
- You’re ready for real ideas and decisions—not just “alignment”

## Let’s Talk

Tell me what’s going on.  
I’ll tell you if I can help.  
No pressure. No awkward sales pitch.
