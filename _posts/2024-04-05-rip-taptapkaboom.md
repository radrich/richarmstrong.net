In a moment of clarity I knew I had to let go of the TapTapKaboom name. It needed to transform into a business. With focus and clarity. Just as I needed to be more authentic and stop trying to teach *everything* to *everyone* under the TapTapKaboom name *and* be an artist under the name. It was too much. It was too confusing.

So. TapTapKaboom is becoming a *real* business—one that teaches tech stuff in an easy, approachable and fun way. Makes sense right!? Tap. Tap. Kaboom.

I almost did this several years ago. But I didn’t want to be a teacher only. At one stage I gave myself an artist moniker “NftyRchy” but decided to merge that side of me in with the teaching side of me. I wanted creative business to be simple. But TapTapKaboom, despite being an epic name, didn’t make sense as an artist’s name. People called me *Tap Tap*, or just *Tap.* It was weird. Another problem I had was teaching a wide range of skills and topics—coding, animation, drawing, art, creativity, productivity, and design. I found it difficult to stick to one thing. I’m ADHD, what do you expect? But it also meant that anyone who followed me for one topic would find me communicating about other topics they weren’t into.

So! I decided to create a new entity focusing on the thing I found the easiest to talk about—it’s also the most popular thing I teach. It’s what I’ve been doing professionally since 2008: designing and coding websites and apps. This way a lot more of what I have to say around these topics would be relevant. But this new entity needed a name.

After weeks of searching for names, I landed at TapTapKaboom. Which is a perfect name for a brand focused on tech—websites, apps, UX, UI, coding. It takes the technical and overwhelming aspects of tech and makes it fun.

At this point it felt like the universe had given me a break. Things clicked into place. I knew there was a bunch of things I had to change (and probably still need to change). It didn’t matter. Things made sense again.

**So, this is how my business world is structured:**

- **TapTapKaboom.** A brand that teaches tech related stuff—coding, UX, UI, websites, apps. I’ll treat this as a *real* business.
- **Rich Armstrong.** The artist. Who illustrates, doodles and creates. And who teaches art-related stuff from a personal, authentic perspective. I’m treating this as a business, but it’ll always be me in front of the camera, always be me doing the drawing.

There’s more I could say about branding, marketing, and business, but having things make sense in your own mind is very important. I’ll leave it at that.
