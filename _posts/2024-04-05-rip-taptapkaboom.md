In a moment of clarity I knew I had to let go of the TapTapKaboom name.

Things finally clicked into place.  
It felt like the universe gave me a break.

I used to call myself TapTapKaboom.  
Then just branded my teaching stuff as TapTapKaboom.  
Now, it’s all me, Rich Armstrong.

I want &amp; need to be authentic.

TapTapKaboom is a brand name—an epic one.  
But it doesn’t make sense for what I’m doing.

So, I’ve shelved TapTapKaboom for a later adventure.  
Maybe to do with marketing or websites.

Now I’m a multi-hyphenate artist who helps other creatives get unstuck.

Same vibes as TapTapKaboom.  
But me being me instead of a “big” brand.

**Note:** the technical transition may take a while.
