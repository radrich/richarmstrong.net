description: "Rich Armstrong evolved TapTapKaboom from a personal brand into a business focused on teaching coding, UX/UI, and app design. Concurrently, he embraced his artist identity under his real name, creating a clear divide between his tech education and artistic endeavors. This restructuring aims for clarity and authenticity in his professional and creative pursuits."

In a moment of clarity I knew I had to let go of the TapTapKaboom name.

I needed to be authentic.

TapTapKaboom is a brand name—an epic one.  
But it doesn’t make sense for what I’m doing.

So. I shelving TapTapKaboom for a later adventure.  
Maybe to do with marketing or websites.

Things finally clicked into place.  
It felt like the universe has given me a break.

Now I’m an artist who helps other creatives.

Me being me.
