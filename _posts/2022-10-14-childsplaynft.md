Child’s Play is an abstract NFT collection made by *my daughter* when she was around 18 months old. There are 101 pieces that she’s created both on iPad and on paper. **This is a very special [collection](https://campfire.exchange/collections/0x063d76a8d094fafad03e7539a8c88bc3fc049423)** that I gifted to collectors of my art in October 2022.

Creating is a joy. It’s play. It’s expressive. Kids do it naturally. Let this abstract collection inspire you to create.
