In cold and rainy November 2024, I flew my family from Amsterdam over to Brighton for a few days to do a mural at SPRO Coffee Co—and to explore the city. I crouched, painted upside down, stood on ladders for hours, and even got my 3-year-old daughter painting some of the “sweet genius” pink splodges.

This is my biggest mural to date. It took 3 days and was a ton of fun. It was mostly freestyle doodling—sometimes I used my notebook or chatted to the owner about an idea or character, like the poopy man saying “This coffee is the sh*t”.

This freestyle doodle adventure brought so many new characters to life—shoutout to Jordi, the owner, for trusting me with the walls! All that practice on the SPRO takeaway cups, loyalty cards, greaseproof paper, and posters definitely paid off.

The mural caught people’s attention—some were even curious enough to come inside for a chat.

P.S. The pink? It’s called SWEET GENIUS.
