Itâ€™s crazy. We live in an era where the grey squishy thing in our skull plays a major role in all aspects of our livesâ€”in work, our personal lives, our decision making, in productivity, in efficacy, and especially in our creativity. Yet rarely do we give it the workout it needs ðŸ˜…

I believe everyone has the capacity to be creative, come up with brilliant ideas, think differently and have super-productive and effective days. We just need to give our *number one tool* a consistent daily workout! Boost your creativity by making your grey squishy thing sweat!

And that's why I developed the Random Word Doodle. It's a 10-day course, where you doodle for a short amount of time everyday. Each day you learn about the benefits of the practice. You can take the course in book, email, or video format. And you donâ€™t have to stop after 10 days.

Iâ€™ve doodled for 100 days in a row before, as have many of my 10 thousand+ students. The difference I saw in my creativity and motivation was crazy. There are tons of benefits to doodling for starters, and when you combine it with doodling random words in a short period of time, there are even more benefits. And then throw in sharing, experimentation and a few other things and youâ€™ve got a super workout for your brain.

I've also created a free app that gives you random words to doodle. It's fun and hopefully brings out a doodling mood.

**20 July 2023 Update:** the app is no longer available to download. But the same functionality exists in the [prompts](/prompts/) section of this website.

## There's a bunch of ways you can get started

- You can take the video class on [Skillshare.](https://ttkb.me/rwd-class)
- I made a [creative prompt](/prompts/random-words/) that generates random words for you.
- Thereâ€™s [a book](https://ttkb.me/unleash) I wrote all about doodling random words.
