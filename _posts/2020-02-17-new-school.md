If you don't like subscription fees, and prefer to purchase classes that are forever yours, all my classes, since the beginning of 2019, are now available on [TapTapKaboom School](https://ttkb.me/school)

I believe there are ways to learn and teach that Skillshare currently doesn’t offer. Think audio, text, questions, prompts, weekly lessons, and a few other ways. I really want to help people develop their creative super-powers, and I believe that new and different ways of teaching will help.

I still love Skillshare—they're amazing. And I'll keep on creating classes that work well for Skillshare—it's great for video-based content and projects! But TapTapKaboom School is something different, something new, something experimental. It's something I hope will help you in different ways than my Skillshare classes do.
