**The first reason** is that you can try Sublime [for free.](https://www.sublimetext.com) And it doesn't cost too much to [buy a license.](https://www.sublimetext.com/buy) You _should_ buy a license if you use it a lot. And _especially_ if you use it to make mooooney ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

**Secondly!** Sublime Text feels faster and more responsive than most other code editors Iâ€™ve tried.

**The third reason** Sublime rocks is that's it's _very customizable._ And this makes it easy to create a coding environment that suits __you.__ So [I made a class](http://skl.sh/2wqklVd) on how you can start customizing it. Watch it. Learn from it and __boom__ ðŸ’¥ you can create your happy coding place! There are so many awesome people that make rad stuff for sublime it's ridiculous (thank you).

Here are a few resources to get you started.

## Fonts
This is a big personal preference. Here are a few lists.

- [Slant.co's list](https://www.slant.co/topics/67/~best-programming-fonts)
- [Wes Bos' list](http://wesbos.com/programming-fonts/)
- [speckyboy.com's free font list](https://speckyboy.com/best-free-fonts-coding/)
- [typecast's list](http://typecast.com/blog/10-fonts-for-code)

## Plugins
There are a lot of pluings for Sublime. Here are a few of my favourites.

- If you write HTML and CSS, Emmet is the best. I have [a class on how to rock n roll with Emmet.](http://skl.sh/2vMvcub)
- [Color Highlighter](https://github.com/Monnoroch/ColorHighlighter) is great for underlining and highlighting hexcodes and other forms of color in text-format.
- [AutoFileName](https://github.com/BoundInCode/AutoFileName) for autocompleting filenames!
- [All Autocomplete](https://github.com/alienhard/SublimeAllAutocomplete) find matches in all open files of the current window and makes suggestion based on that as you type.
- [Browse Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) to find what you want.
- You can also Google "Best Sublime Text Plugins" or "Best Sublime Text plugins for X"

## Themes
Creating your own takes some time. I find other people's choices fantastic. Here are a few I like and a few other places you may want to look.

- [Boxy Theme on Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Boxy%20Theme)

## Color schemes
Colors are important. Especially if you're coming form the design world.

- [Make your own](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/) color scheme.
- Install [Colorâ€‹Schemeâ€‹Selector](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ColorSchemeSelector) for browsing installed color schemes.
- Use [Colorsublime](https://github.com/Colorsublime/Colorsublime-Plugin) to browse and install [Colorsublime](https://colorsublime.github.io/) color schemes.
