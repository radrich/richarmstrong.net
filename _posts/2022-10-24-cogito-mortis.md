*Remember those who walked before.  
Death welcomes all.  
Through ornate doors. A distant shore.  
Death calls for more.  
New worlds. New realms. A settled score.  
Death is in us all.*

Cogito Mortis is the poem above and 52 generative art pieces interpreting it. The collection was sold out in seconds during a [Micro Mint Monday.](https://metapep.com/micro/) Each of the 52 pieces are slightly different from the other pieces in the collection. Each piece is represented by an NFT on the Avalanche blockchain.
