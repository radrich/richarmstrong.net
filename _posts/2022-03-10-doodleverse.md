The Doodleverse is a dream-like universe comprised of multiple dimensions, and is a mix between a fever dream and a vibrant paradise—it’s certainly not of this world. Meet all kinds of weird and wonderful creatures in a variety of dream-like scenes—trees with eyes, castle clouds, vicious plants, creepy hills, and tons of one-eyed birds! Sometimes it’s fun. Sometimes it’s dark. Most of the time it’s weird.

It’s a SOLD OUT collection of 101 unique illustrated an animated NFTs on the Avalanche blockchain. You can view the collection [on Joepegs](https://ttkb.me/ddv) where you can pick up pieces for sale.

The Doodleverse was my first collection on the Avalanche blockchain. It started off as a [100 Day Project]({% link pages/the-perfect-100-day-project-book.md %}) where I created one piece a day. I ended up working on other collections during that 100 Day Project and carried on The Doodleverse well after my 100 Day project had ended.
