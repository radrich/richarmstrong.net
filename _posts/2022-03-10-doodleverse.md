Technically, The Doodleverse is a collection of illustrated NFTs on the Avalanche blockchain. You can view it [on Kalao.](https://ttkb.me/doodleverse-kalao) But it’s obviously so much more than its technical defintion. So what is it? The Doodleverse is a dream-like universe where anything is possible. Singing trees. Birds with worms for tongues. Giant jellyfish. Talking rainbows. That kind of thing. I can’t wait to explore The Doodleverse more, and would love you to join me—if weirdness is your thing.

Every Friday I auction the pieces I create during the week. There’s roughly 7 on auction each week, often with something special for those participating.

**Next Auction:** 8 April 2022 at 9am UTC for 24 hours.


### How Do I Bid for a Doodleverse Piece on Kalao?
1. Get some AVAX on Coinbase (or another crypto marketplace).
2. Send it to your AVAX-compatible wallet. Metamask, on the Avalanche network will do. [This blog post](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4626956-how-do-i-set-up-metamask-on-avalanche) shows you the steps you need to take to get AVAX working on MetaMask.
3. Log in to [the Kalao marketplace](https://marketplace.kalao.io/) using your wallet.
4. Check out [the collection.](https://ttkb.me/doodleverse-kalao)
5. Bid and buy as you wish.
