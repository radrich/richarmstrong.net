The Doodleverse is a collection of NFTs on the Avalanche blockchain, [hosted on Kalao.](https://ttkb.me/doodleverse-kalao) It’s part of my 100 Day Project 2022, where I’m learning all about NFTs, crypto and web3.

The doodleverse is dream-like universe where anything is possible. Singing trees. One-eyed birds with worm tongues. Giant jellyfish. I’m currently fixated on weird birds. I’m ADD and struggle to maintain a single style. But this style is allowing me to flex my imagination, which I’m enjoying a ton. I have ideas being thrown at me from the doodleverse night and day—all I want to do is illustrate (and animate).

There will be 7 pieces [listed for auction](https://ttkb.me/doodleverse-kalao) on Friday 11 March 2022.
