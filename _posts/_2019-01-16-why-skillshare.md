There are hundreds (maybe thousands) of places to learn stuff on the internet. It's radical. It's awesome. It's crazy. But the amount of people that start and then don't finish online courses is massive. And the amount of people who decide to start creating or learning and then stop is also huge. And I think it's got a lot to do with the people you do it with. _Or the people you don't do it with._ A lot of the time, we try learn and create and do things without anyone else around. No support. No one on the same journey. No like-minded people. It's hard to do it like this.

You need a community. You need people who are on the same journey as you. People who understand you. I realised that *this is the biggest thing* that [Skillshare](http://skl.sh/2CRoyn1) actually offers. It has amazing content, just like everyone else. It has amazing teachers, just like everyone else. The Skillshare staff are next level awesome and cool, maybe like some other companies and online platforms (I don't know). **But the thing that sets Skillshare apart is its community.** The students, teachers and staff make up this warm, friendly, and creative community that love learning and creating â€“ and they want to see you succeed.

**So here's my invite to you:** If you want to learn more, have fun creating, and create more often, come join my community. Our community. Come see what it's about. Come create and learn with us. Come [teach.](http://bit.ly/2snF7X8) **Skillshare is $99 a year**â€”which is a crazy good value for money ðŸ’° You can take as many classes as you like, and you get to be apart of this awesome community. And with [this link](https://skl.sh/2I3yuwd) you'll get at a 2 week trial of Skillshare. Skillshare is awesome, and I'd be selfish if I didn't invite you to check it out. And I also think you'd be crazy not to, at least, check it out.
