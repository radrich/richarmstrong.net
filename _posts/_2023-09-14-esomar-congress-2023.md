I was invited to [ESOMAR](https://esomar.org/) Congress 2023 in Amsterdam’s [Beurs van Berlage](https://beursvanberlage.com/) venue to give a keynote presentation and operate a creative booth. I spoke about how magical technology is. And how those who use new technology are often viewed as cheats or magicians.

I created part of [an NFT](https://ttkb.me/changing-realms) artwork on stage. And I also collected the award for best exhibitor—which was maybe *slightly* unfair seeing that I was the only artist exhibiting at the conference.

When I wasn’t on stage I was at my booth—drawing, painting, and meeting neighbouring exhibitors and passerbyers. Also, eating delcious food.

I gave away a ton of postcard-size pieces of art and [Happy Sun stickers.](https://www.redbubble.com/people/happysunfam/shop?artistUserName=HappySunFam&iaCode=all-stickers) I drew on water bottles, chairs, and the 3 big panels of my booth. I painted commissioned pieces, painted pieces to put in frames, painted on canvas, collaborated with poets, signed copies of my [100 Day Project book](/the-perfect-100-day-project-book/), and sold [Happy Sun totes.](https://www.redbubble.com/people/happysunfam/shop?artistUserName=happysunfam&iaCode=all-totes)

On the second day of the conference, the 3-panel artwork was auctioned off to raise funds for [The ESOMAR Foundation.](https://esomarfoundation.org/) Jos Vink from [Blauw Research](https://www.blauw.com/en/) won the auction.

I also created a little treasure hunt for art around the venue. If you found it first you could take it—for free!
