The veil between *The Realm of Dreams* and reality is wafer-thin. Dreams are not *just* bubbling into deamers’ minds, but daydreamers’ too! Creatures, cosmic submarines, and all kinds of imagined beings, are frenzying themselves about the realm of reality.

Soon, the thin veil will fall.

*Reverie* a collection of 25 unique pieces, including an animation, and they’re minted as NFTs on the Avalanche blockchain. You can view the collection [on Salvor](https://salvor.io/collections/0xe68e14c8fe982d432277643315b2d97fdd90b78a) where you can pick up pieces for sale.

I wanted to pick up The Doodleverse story from [The Dreamheadz](/dreamheadz) collection, and set the background for my Avaissance collection called LIMINA (coming late 2023).
