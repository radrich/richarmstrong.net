In April 2021 I sent out an open invite to my Newsletter Subscribers and Skillshare followers to collaborate on a super long Exqusite Corpse.

An Exquisite Corpse is where a few people contribute toward a ‘body’. Typically someone draws the head, someone else the body, and someone else the legs. But with this project there were 17 of us who contributed to it.

## Why This Project?
Because we’d been in some form of COVID lockdown for over a year!  
I wanted to connect with people in a fun way.

## The Result
