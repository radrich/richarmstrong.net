*Genny* is a new and different kind of magic to [The Doodleverse.](/doodleverse) The collection’s made up of an ever increasing amount of generative art. Generative art is art that’s made with code. I’m using [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to create the pieces. Each piece is derived from an algorithm I’ve written.

New algorithms are introduced every few weeks, making this a collection of collections of generative art. The things that tie each piece together are the colours and the artist.

Most Gennys are designed at a *massive* size—perfect for [printing.](https://joepegs.com/collections/avalanche/genny?attributes=%5B%7B%22traitType%22%3A%22Type%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%22Print%22%5D%7D%5D) I’d love to see you print, frame, and share your Gennys with me and the community. Other Gennys are [animated.](https://joepegs.com/collections/avalanche/genny?attributes=%5B%7B%22traitType%22%3A%22Type%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%22Animation%22%5D%7D%5D) When this is the case I’ve generated frames, compiled them together and exported a video file. 

I began creating art with code again when I grew tired of drawing every day—maybe I was even slightly burned out. And it’s done wonders for my creativity. Creating with the other side of my brain, or perhaps a mixture of both sides, feels different. It’s mathematical. It’s random. And it’s producing a different type of beauty. And I have so many ideas for generative art!
