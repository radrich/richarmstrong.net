description: "Rich Armstrong evolved TapTapKaboom from a personal brand into a business focused on teaching coding, UX/UI, and app design. Concurrently, he embraced his artist identity under his real name, creating a clear divide between his tech education and artistic endeavors. This restructuring aims for clarity and authenticity in his professional and creative pursuits."

**So, this is how my business world is structured:**

- **TapTapKaboom.** A brand that teaches tech-related stuff in a fun and approachable way—coding, UX, UI, websites, apps.
- **Rich Armstrong.** The artist. Who illustrates, doodles and creates. And who teaches art-related stuff from a personal, authentic perspective.
