**Happy Sun** is a beloved character from The Doodleverse, who has magic powers and puts everyone in a good mood. So, creating this NFT collection was super fun and it made tons of people really happy! As a collection, Happy Sun is a 101 piece 1/1 PFP collection on Avalanche. You can view the collection [on OpenSea](https://ttkb.me/happysun) where you can pick up suns for sale.

We celebrate **Happy Sun Day** on Thursdays and rock our Happy Sun PFPs in social media settings to *#spreadTheHappy.* Happy Sun has his/her own [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/HappySunFam), and we often host Twitter spaces to chat and hang out.
