People keep telling me “NFTs R deAd.” I don’t believe them. They’re forever. They’re culture. They’re change. They’re the future. R NFTs DeAd? Nah. Art never dies. Let’s keep creating.

To celebrate Halloween, and the “death of NFTS”, I created [4 x *R DeAd* collectibles](https://ttkb.me/rdead) that are minting for 0.01Ξ until the beginning of November. That’s about $20. If you mint all 4 I’ll airdrop you a special piece in November.

### Details
- 4628 x 6545 px (slightly smaller than A2 size) 300dpi
- Mediums: Photography, Printer, Scanner, Procreate, Photoshop, Adobe Fresco
- [Mint](https://ttkb.me/rdead) for 0.01Ξ until the beginning of November
