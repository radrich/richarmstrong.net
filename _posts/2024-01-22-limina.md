<p class="notice">üö® The 7 LIMINA pieces are being auctioned off from 25 March‚Äì3 April on Salvor. <a href="#times">View auction times</a></p>

{% include glider.html imgs=page.slider_images %}

After [The Dreamheadz](/dreamheadz) found their way into The Realm of Dreams, everyone wanted access. The Order built seven gates leading to the epicentre of the [Doodleverse.](/tags/doodleverse/) They called it Project LIMINA. But, upon their completion, the gates buckled and broke. Cosmic waves rippled through the realms. The Doodleverse began to unravel. The Shadow reemerged. Creatures fled their homes. Glitches appeared. It was chaos. But, a single gate remains open.

With LIMINA, I collaborated with other ‚Äúrealms‚Äù of myself. I used different styles, skillsets, and methods within single pieces. Some methods include collage, doodling, abstract art, and generative art (code art). The collection touches on the topics of chaos, ADHD, and artistic influence.

Each of the seven pieces is a 1/1 ERC-721. Auction winners will receive a framed and signed archival print. The frame contains an NFC chip. The chip, when scanned, provides further information and provenance.

These pieces are the biggest pieces I‚Äôve created. They‚Äôre 5X bigger than my pieces in my [Doodleverse collection](/doodleverse), and 3X bigger than pieces in my [For Love collection.](/for-love)
