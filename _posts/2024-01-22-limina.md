After [The Dreamheadz](/dreamheadz) found their way into The Realm of Dreams, everyone wanted access. The Order built seven gates leading to the epicentre of the [Doodleverse.](/tags/doodleverse/) They called it Project LIMINA. But, upon their completion, the gates buckled and broke. Cosmic waves rippled through the realms. The Doodleverse began to unravel. The Shadow reemerged. Creatures fled their homes. Glitches appeared. It was chaos. But, a single gate remains open.

{% include glider.html imgs=page.slider_images %}

With LIMINA, I collaborated with other “realms” of myself. I used different styles, skillsets, and methods within single pieces. Some methods include collage, doodling, abstract art, and generative art (code art). The collection touches on the topics of chaos, ADHD, and artistic influence.

Each of the seven pieces is a 1/1 ERC-721. Initial holders receive a framed and signed archival print. The frame contains an NFC chip. The chip, when scanned, provides further information and provenance.
