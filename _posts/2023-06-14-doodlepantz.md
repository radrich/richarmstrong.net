Doodle Pantz is a *collaborative* and *experimental* NFT collection. The NFTs in most collections cannot be changed—their image, description, title, and attributes are immutable. Fixed. Set-in-stone. But with Doodle Pantz, the image and the attributes are customisable. Which means we can collaboarte to design you a sweet pair of $Pantz. Each $Pantz token can be customised only once. Once you’ve got your $Pantz and you’re ready to customise it, send it over and we can begin the process! The initial size of the collection will be 60 items, with 5 $Pantz being released for minting at a time.

**There are 6 styles:** briefs, bikini, boxers, boyshorts, hipster, and trunks. You can see them below.

### How It Works
- [Mint](https://ttkb.me/doodlepantzmint) $Pantz for 14.95 $AVAX each, or find uncustomised ones on the secondary market.
- When you’re ready, transfer your $Pantz NFT to <strong class="ellipsis-overflow">0x767dC13B7C297b214489d7324652830570A5A108</strong>
- Get in touch with me, either on [Twitter](https://ttkb.me/twitter) or [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/915986990971899974), and we’ll collaborate on your $Pantz customisation.
- When it’s customised I’ll send it back to the wallet address it was sent from and lock the customisation ability to prevent any further changes.
