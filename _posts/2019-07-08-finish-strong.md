Finishing has never been my strength. I start projects much quicker than I finish them. When I get close to the end of a project my brain becomes fixated on the next thing. The new thing. The possibilities. The options. All the time I'll have on my hands.

It’s something I've worked on over the past few years. And it's something I have to resist on every project.

I've come to realise that completing a project *well* is what sets it apart. It's what makes it memorable. Complete it. Put the finishing touches on. Polish it. Make it easy to access. Put it in your portfolio. On your website. In a book. A video. Post it. Make it public. Tell the world about it.

Don’t just get on to the next thing. Spend time with your baby that you’ve brought into the world. Be proud of your work. Reflect. Maybe even promote it. And most of all, you need to celebrate and take a break! Do something fun!

**Finish Strong.**
