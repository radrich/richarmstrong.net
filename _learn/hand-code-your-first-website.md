### The class covers these 5 things:
1. Writing and structuring content with HTML
2. Styling your site with CSS
3. Backing-up your code
4. Making it mobile-friendly
5. Getting it online for the world to see

### What’s included?
- 4 hour Hand-Code Your First Website Course video course (32 lessons).
- 7 PDF resources including common HTML elements, CSS properties, and extra tools &amp; resources.
- Feedback on the website your create.
- Help when you’re stuck.
- Answers to your questions.

### Who’s this course for?
- **Creatives Wanting More Control.** Are you tired of templates and overwhelming CMS systems? Want to take back control & have creative freedom over your website?
- **The Structred Creative.** If you like structure &amp; want to express yourself without needing to paint or draw, you’ll love coding (and this course).
- **Technophobes.** Does technology scare you a bit (that’s okay). You’ll love this step-by-step course.
- **The Overwhelmed Newbie.** Have you got overwhelmed learning to code before? Don’t worry, it happens. This course makes coding simple &amp; approachable.

For me, being able to create my own websites with HTML and CSS has been empowering. Liberating. And a way to expressing myself. It's also given me opportunities to freelance, work for agencies &amp; startups, and run my own studio.

During the class you'll be creating a website for your favourite cartoon hero. I'll share my insights and best practices for planning and creating a simple website. We'll cover browsers, code editors, planning, how to back up your code, and how to publish your website.

You'll see that it's not that hard or scary to create a website! Whether you're an absolute novice or have dabbled in some web design and development before, by the end of this class you'll know how to hand-code basic websites and have a solid foundation to add further web-related learning to.

Also, your friends will be jealous and your mom will be super proud.

And you'll feel like Neo from The Matrix.
