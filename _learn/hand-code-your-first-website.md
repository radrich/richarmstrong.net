This class is a fun and approachable exploration of hand-coding your first website.

### The class covers these 5 things:

- Writing and structuring content with HTML
- Styling your site with CSS
- Backing-up your code
- Making it mobile-friendly
- Getting it online for the world to see

For me, being able to create my own websites with HTML and CSS has been empowering. Liberating. And a way of creating and expressing myself. It's also given me opportunities to freelance, work for agencies, work at startups, and run my own studio.

During the class you'll be creating a website for your favourite cartoon hero. I'll share my insights and best practices for planning and creating a simple one-page website. We'll cover browsers, code editors, planning, how to back up your code, and how to publish your website.

You'll see that it's not that hard or scary to create a website! Whether you're an absolute novice or have dabbled in some web design and development before, by the end of this class you'll know how to hand-code basic websites and have a solid foundation to add further web-related learning to. Also, your friends will be jealous and your mom will be super proud. And you'll feel like Neo from The Matrix.
