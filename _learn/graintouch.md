**Overwhelmed by the endless tools, options, and settings in today’s digital drawing apps?**

Wish digital drawing felt more fun, light, and playful?

Meet [Graintouch.](https://heyrich.net/graintouch-app) An iPad app with minimal everything: UI, colours, tools, options, settings. But maximum joy. It’s delightfully simple (and simply delightful) to use.

Think risograph for iPad. Rough. Gritty. Textured. Full of analog character.

Make art that feels grainy, gradiented, and full of IRL imperfections—like it rolled right off the printing press.

### In this course, I’ll walk you through:

- The tools, settings, and hidden gems inside Graintouch
- How the layers interact (spoiler: it’s magical)
- Tips for getting that “printy” handmade look
- How to extract and play with the underlying SVG files
- Loads of playful examples, tips, tricks, and inspiration

The 1-hour course is perfect for illustrators, designers, and doodlers who want to break free from polished perfection—and an overwhelming amount of options found in most apps these days—and explore the beauty of imperfection.

Ready to rediscover the joy of digital art?

Take the course and start creating print-inspired digital art today.
