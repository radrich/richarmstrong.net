## What is a 100 Day Project?
It’s where you do something ‘creative’ for 100 days. ‘Creative’ doesn’t only mean drawing or painting. It means intentionally doing something to make your life better—doing something new or different. Every 100 Day Project will look different—and different for different stages of your life. No project is the same. I want you to do the perfect project for you and where you are right now. 100 Day Projects change lives. In small ways. And in big ways.

### The book answers questions like:
- What is a 100 Day Project?
- How do I choose my 100 Day Project?
- Should I share my 100 Day Project?
- What if I develop imposter syndrome?
- and tons more!

## *The* 100 Day Project
You may have heard of *The* 100 Day Project and wondering if this book and that thing are realted. *The* is italicised because all *The* 100 Day Project is, is an annual version of a 100 Day Project that gets done by a whole bunch of people. And it’s rad! Because there’s so many people doing it all at the same time. There are official Q&A sessions, there’s a Facebook group, and thousands of people are sharing, and struggling, and going through this life changing journey together.

But all that may not be what you want. Or maybe you want to do your 100 Day Project right now. And *The* 100 Day Project may not be running right now. Or it may be half-way through. Or you may want to plan exactly when you do it each year, and not rely on someone else choosing the date. Whatever the reason, you don’t have to wait for *The* 100 Day Project to start before you start *your* 100 Day Project. But if you’re about to start, and *The* 100 Day Project is about to begin, I’d suggest you join the masses and do it with them!
