## There’s got to be a better way
Do you feel like there’s a better way to be productive than using a combination of apps, calendars, websites, paper lists, and post-it notes?

Rich did.

​Are you anxious, overwhelmed, or overstimulated by the thoughts, ideas, tasks, and experiences running through your head?

Rich was.

He had tasks and projects and notes in all kinds of places. He got distracted easily. He forgot ideas and was never sure where he should put a thought or idea.

​That’s when he discovered Bullet Journaling (BuJo for short).

## ​What is Bullet Journaling?

​BuJo is a powerful and flexible productivity method you practice in a notebook.

Rich has been using it since 2021. It’s been life-changing for him. He doesn’t get distracted (a massive thing for someone with ADHD). He doesn’t get overwhelmed. He’s no longer working on 45 things at the same time. And he’s able to calmly capture his thoughts and ideas without fear of losing or misplacing them.

​Over time he’s begun to work on, and accomplish, what matters most in his life.
