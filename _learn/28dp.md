### Stuck in “I’ll get to it someday” mode?

Whether you want to build a creative habit, finish a side project, improve your health, or learn a new skill, the 28 day structure helps you move from ideas in your head to real progress in your life.

### The 28 day project (28dp) method helps you:

- Set one clear focus.
- Take small daily actions (even 5 minutes counts).
- Review and adjust on a weekly basis.
- Build momentum & confidence.
- Make sustainable progress.

Instead of burning out on huge goals or abandoning long challenges, you’ll learn a *just-right* framework that fits inside a real, messy life—with work, family, and low-energy days included.

### What you’ll learn inside this course

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to:

- **Use the 28 day project structure.** Understand exactly how a 28dp works, how to start, and how to repeat it every month so you keep making progress.
- **Choose the right project for this season of your life.** Use practical exercises to brain-dump ideas, filter the noise, and pick a project that’s exciting *and* realistic.  
- **Beat procrastination with tiny daily wins.** Design a project that works even if you’re tired, busy, or perfectionistic—by focusing on daily contact, not daily completion.
- **Build habits that actually stick.** Turn your project into a simple daily ritual, anchored to your existing routines, so showing up becomes easier over time.
- **Use weekly checkpoints to stay on track.** Follow guided reflection prompts at the end of weeks 1–4 so you can adjust quickly, instead of quitting when things get hard.
- **Turn lessons into long-term change.** Capture what you’ve learned about yourself, your patterns, and your craft so each 28 day project upgrades the next one.
    
You’ll also get **project ideas, check-in questions, braindump prompts, and practical tips** for removing friction, tracking your streak, and staying motivated—especially on the days you don’t feel like it.

### Who this 28 day project course is for

This course is perfect if you:

- Have **too many ideas** and never know what to focus on.
- Start projects, but **struggle to finish** them.
- Feel overwhelmed by big goals, long challenges, or complicated systems.
- Want a **simple, flexible structure** you can reuse every month.
- Are a creative, maker, or multi-passionate human who wants to **see real progress** without burning out.

If you’ve ever thought *“I just need a clear plan and some gentle structure”* this is it.

### **What you need**

- No fancy tools. No special software.
- 5–30 minutes a day you can dedicate to your project.
- I’ll walk you through the rest.

### Why take this course now?

With a 28 day project, you don’t wait until life calms down—you **design a tiny, winnable game** that fits the life you already have.
