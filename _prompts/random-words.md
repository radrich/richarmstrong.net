Set a timer. 5 minutes is great. Then doodle one of these random words (or whatever comes to mind).

<ul class="_random random masonry" data-child="li" data-amount="11" data-template="[[ mix ]]" data-params='{"collections": ["random-words", "animals-signular", "food-singular", "verbs-present", "objects", "nouns-singular"]}'></ul>

_**Variation #1:** Doodle as many of the words as you can in the time limit._  
_**Variation #2:** Pick 2 words and doodle that combination._  
_**Variation #3:** Doodle as many combinations as you can in the time limit._
