It’s quite a thing designing and illustrating a pattern that’s gonna go on dudes’ butts. But I did it. And tons of boys and men across Europe have my design on their butts thanks to the boxer short subscription service [On That Ass.](https://onthatass.com/) The tricky bit was having to use vector without any gradients. It was quite a step away from my recent comfortzone of [The Doodleverse](/tags/doodleverse/) style. They also made some sweet socks to go with the boxer shorts.

The *On That Ass* team came up with a great campaign and visuals for the design too.

Below are some details of the actual boxer shorts.
