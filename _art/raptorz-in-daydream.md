*It really was a funny thing. Raptorz began appearing in The Doodleverse. Who was dreaming of them? How many were there to be? And all of a sudden the dreams stopped. Only five of them. It could only mean one thing: day dreaming. Of Raptorz.*

“Raptorz in Daydream” is a collab project between myself and [RaptOriginZ.](https://twitter.com/RaptOriginZ) I took a naked raptor from their [genesis collection](https://marketplace.kalao.io/collection/0x9f98ccebdb3138c0ebfbdc9b9b94e2683bdaf1fb) and created 5 [Doodleverse-inspired](/doodleverse) dream versions of them. The pieces were auctioned off in 1 hour [on Kalao](https://ttkb.me/raptz), while we chatted [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/richarmstr_ong/status/1574755059002445830), with each auction lasting roughly 10 minutes.
