I have friends who like this colour green. The same friends have a kid who loves my doodles. So guess who got a super rad mural birthday gift?

I managed to find the exact right paint colour. I did some rough planning and sketching on my iPad, got some feedback, and then did a day of mural painting—with a little help from the kid.

It was fun to paint in such a tight space, and in a pre-planned way.
