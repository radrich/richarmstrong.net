**Phone covers are an amazing way to make a statement.**

Or make people smile.  
Especially if they look closer.  
And *really* observe.

So, I made a cheeky cover for those weird photo situations.  
You know... where you’re there for what feels like *forever* trying to get the perfect shot.

The one without the seagull.  
Without the photobomber.  
Without her picking her nose.  

The one where’s she actually smiling.  
And not worrying about her looks.
