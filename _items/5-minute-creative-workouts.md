**Creativity is powerful and important. But too few of us take the time to keep our creativity in shape.** In fact, we often let our creativity wither and atrophy. Which is no good to anyone.

So how do we get and keep it in shape? By intentionally and consistently making our creative muscle sweat and burn! And that’s what this class offers: a bunch of fun 5 minute creative workouts to strengthen and grow your creative muscle!

These workouts will transform how you think and work, and maybe even how you live. During the class we’ll go over how they help, how to do them, and a few variations to try out. We’ll also go over designing your own workout—one that will suit your needs and situation.

If you want to get your creativity in shape, come join the class!
