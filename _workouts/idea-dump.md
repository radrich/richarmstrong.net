## Idea Quantity Leads to Idea Quality

Give yourself 5â€“10 minutes to come up with as many ideas for one of these topics as you can.

<ul class="_random random masonry" data-child="li" data-amount="11" data-template="[[ mix ]]" data-params='{"collections": ["adjectives", "food-singular", "verbs-present", "objects", "nouns-plural"]}'></ul>

_Instead of one of these topics, you could generate ideas for something specific._
