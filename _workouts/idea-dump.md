Give yourself 5â€“10 minutes to come up with as many ideas for one of these topics as you can.

<ul class="_random random masonry" data-child="li" data-amount="7" data-template="Hey [[ mix ]] there" data-params='{"collections": ["adjectives", "food-singular"]}'></ul>

Instead of one of these topics, you could use the time to generate ideas for something specific.
