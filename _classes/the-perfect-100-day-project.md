The 100 Day Project is an epic thing. You choose a creative project, do it every day for 100 days, and share your process online. And although you can do one at any point and time, there is an [offical version](https://the100dayproject.org/) that happens once a year. If you're stuck, frustrated or not achieving the success and quality of work (or life) you're after, come see what a 100 Day Project is, and how it will fuel a creative renaissance in your life.

100 Day Projects are awesome, but they can also be frustrating. So, I made a [30 minute class](https://ttkb.me/perfect-100-day-proj) and [a book]({% link pages/the-perfect-100-day-project-book.md %}), published by RockyNook, to guide you in the process. Check out the class intro below.

## What The Class Covers

This class focuses on coming up with a 100 Day Project of your own. One that's perfect *for you.* One that boosts your creativity. One you wake up excited for. The class also helps you prepare for the 100 days.

Choosing your project is where majority of the 30 minutes class is spent, but it also covers often asked questions, some inspirational projects and ideas, and a bunch of hints and tips for starting and completing an awesome 100 Day Project.
