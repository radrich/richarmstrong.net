The 100 Day Project is an epic thing. You choose a creative project, do it every day for 100 days, and share your process online. And although you can do one at any point and time, there is an [offical version](https://the100dayproject.org/) that happens once a year. This year the 8th edition kicks off on January 31. If you're stuck, frustrated or not achieving the success and quality of work you're after, come see what a 100 Day Project is, and how it will fuel a creative renaissance in your life.

100 Day Projects are awesome, but they can also be frustrating. So, I made a class to guide you in the process. Check out the intro below.
