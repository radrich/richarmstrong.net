**We all want to be productive right!? I mean, what’s the alternative?**

So we learn all about the productivity systems, we geek out on productivity tips & tricks, and download all the right apps and tools. But after a few weeks, or maybe even days, we end up at the same unproductive place. Procrastinating, burned out, overwhelmed, or jumping from thing to thing to thing without finishing anything. And that’s because we don’t have a foundation. We don’t truly know why we want to be productive in the first place.

The best productivity advice doesn’t work for long unless what you’re doing is linked to a purpose you care deeply about. If you don’t know where you’re heading and why you’re heading there, you have no good way of knowing what to spend your time on. Knowing this is the foundation of productivity and success. And that’s what this class covers: **helping you figure out what to spend your time doing.**
