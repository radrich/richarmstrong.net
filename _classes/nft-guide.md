## Let’s Dive into The World of NFTs

Hey! I’m Rich Armstrong. I’m a multi-hyphenate artist. I created my first NFT in 2019. Since then I’ve created more than 20 NFT collections on several different blockchains using different styles of art. I’ve collaborated with 100+ brands and artists, made over $100,000 selling NFTs, and know how overwhelming it is to get going in the fast-paced world of NFTs.

I’m not just an artist though—I’ve authored books and taught 250k+ students online. So, you’re in good hands.

This guide simplifies the complexities of the NFT world into actionable steps. You’ll go from noob to NFT Yellow-belt Ninja in a single sitting.
