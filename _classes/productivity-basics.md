**This beginner’s productivity class jumps into the basics of being productive and covers 4 simple and practical productivity practices:**

- Bringing order to your spaces.
- Reducing distractions.
- Writing everything down.
- Prioritising what’s important.

Besides those 4 things, we’ll also cover what productivity is, what tools I use, and we’ll end the class by going through a framework for becoming even more productive on your own—so you can discover what makes *you* productive, and then put it into practice.

Maybe you’ve just started freelancing. Maybe you want to take what you’re doing to the next level. Maybe, like me, you struggle to get things done (I have ADD) but you’re not going to let that get in your way. It *is* possible to be productive—despite your challenges—when you know how!

If you want to get more done, and you want simple and effective steps to take, join me in this productivity class. Even though this class is made for beginners, you’ll gain some actionable insights and advice no matter who you are.

All you’ll need to take this class is a pen and some paper!
